          <h3>Linnaeus's Flower Clock</h3>
          <br/>
          <p>Linnaeus's flower clock (horologium florae) created by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century, is a conceptual timepiece that uses the blooming and closing patterns of various plants to indicate the time of day. The clock is based on the idea that different flowers open and close at specific times, with some flowers opening in the morning, others in the afternoon, and some at night. The flower clock demonstrated the natural rhythms of plants and their response to light, creating a symbolic way to tell time based on the flora's behavior.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>This website brings Linnaeus's vision to life by featuring the plants he recommended in his design. Use the arrow buttons or arrow keys to adjust the time of day and observe the flowers as they open and close. The time will automatically reset to the current time after 10 seconds, or you can click the clock to reset it manually.</p>
