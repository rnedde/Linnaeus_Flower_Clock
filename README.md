Experience time in bloom! This extension visualizes Linnaeus’s Flower Clock, showing flowers opening and closing based on the hour.

Inspired by Carl Linnaeus's 18th-century Flower Clock, this extension transforms your browser into a dynamic botanical timepiece. Linnaeus observed that different flowers open and close at specific times of the day, creating a natural way to tell time.

With this extension, you can watch flowers bloom and close in real-time based on the current hour. Adjust the time manually using arrow keys or buttons to see how the floral display changes throughout the day. After 10 seconds, the clock resets to the present time, keeping the experience in sync with nature.

Features:
Real-time floral animation based on Linnaeus’s original flower clock concept
Interactive time controls to explore different hours of the day
Auto-reset function to sync back to the present time
A visually soothing experience that connects timekeeping with nature
Bring the rhythm of nature to your browser and watch time bloom!
